One of the best places...
One of the best places to go for authentic Indian food! I love the flavors at Viceroy and
the staff is really friendly and helpful. Being Indian, 
I like the fact that the food is absolutely authentic and healthy (not submerged in loads and loads of oil like other places).
 You won't be disappointed, your stomach will be happy and your wallet won't be completely empty... take it from me, 
I'm a student again. I have even frequented their Lombard location for the lunch buffet when I used to work in the area and I would totally recommend the place to others.
 The buffet is a great deal - lots of variety.
This place is spiced just right. Four samosa's for Viceroy!!!

OUTSTANDING ENVIRONMENT,TOTALLY LOVED IT
